It features the commands /play [song], /pause, /resume, /playing, /queue, and /skip <br>

### Blackloading System

It also has a system of background loading. To avoid blocking when loading long playlists, only the first songs are loaded into the queue. The rest are moved to a different queue, where they can be loaded safely while the listener listens to the music loaded.

# Commands
### /Play [song]
